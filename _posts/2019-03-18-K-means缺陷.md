FCM方向做多了，回头顺便想了想K-means的缺陷:

1. With respect to the object function, standard K-means clustering algorithm shows underlying sentisitity to `outlier` and `noisy` datasets.
2. Face with the `size-imbalance` & `dimensional-imbalance` problems. 
3. Donnot meet the `real-time` requirements for large scale datasets clustering.
4. To deal with `high-dimenstional` datasets, additional low-rank processings or sparse weighting operators for feature selection are required.
5. `Hard Logic` rooting in K-means is not quite suitable for partitioning datums of overlapped distributions or lying in manifold space, resulting in the degradation of model generalization.
6. Etc.
